				* Our calculation of the transfer of velocity between two balls with (possibly)
				* different masses in 2d space is built on the formula for calulating the transfer of velocity
				* in 1d space which itself is derived from the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy.
				* 
				* The difference when you do it in 2d is simply that you find the velocity in the direction of the
				* normal vector (the vector between the center of the  two balls) and then just use the same formula
				* as in 1d space. The velocity in the direction of the tangent does not change since the balls dont exert
				* any force in that direction. 
				* 
				* We chose a linear algebra approach since it was more intative to us, linear algebra is also a very powerful
				* tool for solving problems in physics and computer science since the computer can work with vectors
				* very efficinetly (however this is a bit trivial in this assignment since we arent using hardware acceleration anyways).
				* Its worth noting that you can solve this problem using equivalently using trigonometry.
				*
				* We also want to say that we know this caluclation can be made much shorter and much more "single expression-y" but
				* we chose to make it more verbose to make it easier to understand and imrpove readability. Since this task
				* is about understanding how to model physics rather than maximizing performance we think this is a good tradeoff.
